# Starting with the Create React application

This Signaturit Challenge Test started with [Create a reaction application] (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Scripts available

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the application in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

This is a test challenge that made me perform the Signaturit startup.
In which I had to create a simple Crud according to the design I was previously given.
